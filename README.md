# odin-recipes

This is a short project to re-enforce the HTML skills I've learnt.

Once complete, I will have demonstrated the following:
1. Creating an HTML index page with links to recipes
2. Recipe pages with images, headers and lists


When finished, return to this file and update with what I have actually demonstrated.
